<h1>libVexDuino</h1>
This is the main page for libVexDuino - a linux library for the VEXPro
ARM9 Microcontroller -&nbsp;which &nbsp;provides a measure of Arduino
language compatibility.
<h1>Introduction</h1>
LibVexDuino provides partial compatibility with the Arduino at the API
level. This means that you can build many programs written in the
Arduino language using the Terk-IDE, which is part of the VEXPro
controller software, and run them on the VEXPro controller.<br>
libVexDuino consists of several include files and the library file
libvexduino.a. Note the difference in capitalization of the library
filename. <br>
<h1>LibVexDuino Installation</h1>
Before using libVexDuino you must install it using the following
procedure. You should have already installed the VEXPro development
environment by following the instructions <a
 href="http://code.google.com/p/terk-ide/wiki/InstallationInstructions">here</a>.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Open a cygwin shell (You
installed cygwin as part of the Terk-IDE installation.)</li>
  <li>cd to the directory where
you installed libVexDuino</li>
  <li>Run "make". This will install libVexDuino in the Terk build
directories</li>
</ol>
<h1>Porting an Arduino Sketch to
VEXPro</h1>
These instructions explain how to take an Arduino sketch that builds
using the Ardino IDE and can be downloaded and run on an Arduino and
make minor modifications that allow it to build using the VEXPro
Terk-IDE and to be downloaded, run and debugged on a VEXPro. The
instructions use the&nbsp;Arduino Blink program as an example. The
Blink example program is found in the libVexDuino/examples/1.Basics
folder, and is a port of the corresponding Arduino example sketch. It
blinks an LED connected to Digital I/O 13 about once a second. Adapt
the instructions depending on the location of the Arduino program you
want to port to VEXPro.<br>
<br>
You should have already downloaded the libVexDuino and installed it
using the instructions above. <br>
<h2>Copy the Arduino Sketch to a .cpp File</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Copy the folder containing
the Arduino sketch you want to run on VEXPro to a suitable location
which doesn't have a space in the folder name. A good location is
\Users\&lt;myUserName&gt;\workspace. A bad location is"My
Documents\Arduino"
(space in the folder name).</li>
  <li>Rename the Arduino sketch
file by changing the filename extension to .cpp from .pde or .ino. (You
can do this with Windows Explorer, or from the cygwin shell using the
mv command.).&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Create the Terk IDE Project</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Create a new project using
the Terk-IDE. You can create a new project using existing Arduino
source code by clicking the "Create New Project" button in the Terk
Navigator pane of the Terk-IDE.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>In the project creation
dialog, uncheck "Use default location" and use the browse button to
navigate to the location of your Arduino sketch.&nbsp;</li>
  <li>Give the project a name,
e.g. Blink, and &nbsp;press the Finish button. You should see the
new Blink project in the left project explorer pane of the Terk IDE..</li>
  <li>Right-click the new project
and select properties. A dialog pops up which lets you set library
paths.</li>
  <li>Expand the "C/C++ Build" section in the left pane and click the
"Settings" entry</li>
  <li>On the "Tool Settings" tab,
click on the "Libraries" settings icon in the "TerkOS C++ Linker
(cygwin" section.</li>
  <li>The upper section of the
"Libraries" settings lists the libraries that are used for this VEXPro
project. Click the + icon above the libraries and add "vexduino" as a
library. (Note - the lib part of the filename is dropped - and it's all
lower-case.). Use the "up
arrow" to move vexduino to the top of the list of libraries.</li>
  <li>Press OK to close the
project properties.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2>Modify and Build the Arduino Sketch</h2>
<ol>
  <li>In the Terk IDE, click the
arrow to expand the new project, and double-click the sketch (now a
.cpp source file)
to open it</li>
  <li>Add the following line at
the top of the sketch source code (.cpp file).&nbsp;
#include "Arduino.h"</li>
  <li>If your sketch calls any functions within the sketch, declare
them at the top of the file. See below for an example.</li>
  <li>You can add C/C++/Linux library functions if you want. A useful
one to include is "#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;", which allows you to use
printf("The value of x is %d\n", x); for displaying program execution
status. See the Blink2 project for an example of how to do this.</li>
  <li>If your sketch calls functions, define them at the top of the
sketch. See the bottom of this section for instructions on how to do
so, and Blink2.cpp for an example.</li>
  <li>Right-click on the project and select "Clean Project". This will
build the project (sketch) from scratch.</li>
  <li>In the lower pane of the Terk IDE, click the "Console" tab and
look at the build output for any compilation or linker errors that may
have occurred, and correct them. The "Problems" tab may also be
helpful, as you can double-click on a problem and the IDE will take you
straight to the source code line with the problem.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Function Declaration</h3>
If your sketch looks like this:<br>
<code>setup() { // do nothing }<br>
</code><code>loop()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; val = foo(x);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // call function foo() to do
something<br>
}<br>
int foo(int i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // function foo definition<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; return (i*2);<br>
}<br>
</code><code></code>Change it to declare function foo at the start of
the file, as shown below. Tell the compiler what the type of any
arguments to the function are, and what type it returns. The semicolon
after the function declaration tells the compiler it is a declaration
and not a definition.<br>
<code>#include "Arduino.h"<br>
int foo(int);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // function foo() declaration<br>
setup() { // do nothing }<br>
loop()<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; val = foo(x);&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // call function foo() to do
something<br>
}<br>
int foo(int i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; // function foo definition<br>
{<br>
&nbsp; ...<br>
&nbsp; return (i*2);<br>
}</code><br>
<code></code><code></code>
<h2>Run the Arduino Sketch</h2>
From here on out, things just get easier and more powerful. Follow the
Terk IDE example <a
 href="http://code.google.com/p/terk-ide/wiki/QuickIDEExample">here</a>
to create a connection to the VEXPro and load and debug the Arduino
sketch<a href="http://code.google.com/p/terk-ide/wiki/QuickIDEExample"></a>.
You can set breakpoints in your&nbsp;sketch, and single-step the
program from the Terk IDE (something requiring significant skill and
external equipment on a real Arduino). <br>
