This program connects to Roborealm running on a PC, and runs some of the API tests. It should print "Done" when complete. It is primarily useful to test that you can connect to Roborealm on the PC.

The PC running roborealm is at the IP address specified with the SERVER #define near the beginning of main.cpp. Be sure you've opened up port 6060 on the Windows firewall or the program won't be able to connect.

Import the project into the Terk IDE by right-clicking in the project explorer and selecting "Import", to import the project. It will build automatically.
